1
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,613
Impossible. Impossible.

2
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,658
Nothing is impossible.

3
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,452
Come on, Mouse.

4
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,915
Dig!

5
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,626
Mouse, come on.

6
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,197
-Jehan.
-Yes, sir.

7
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,991
Get the next three.

8
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,671
Two more.

9
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,721
- Over there.
- Hurry up!

10
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,807
-Move!
- Take two.

11
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,019
- I want Phillipe Gaston.
-This is the cell, sir.

12
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:42,073
Wrong cell. I want Phillipe Gaston,
the one they call the Mouse.

13
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,992
The Mouse? Mouse.

14
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,040
The Mouse, he left our house.

15
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,877
No Mouse today. He's run away.

16
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,340
To ease the pain, he's down the drain!

17
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,552
-Where is he?
-I already told you, gentle lord.

18
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,223
Hang him. Search every sewer, every drain.

19
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:11,394
Find him, or Captain Marquet
will hang you in his place.

20
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,812
You can't hang me!

21
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,023
Impossible. Nobody could escape
through there.

22
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,703
It's not unlike escaping Mother's womb.

23
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,539
God, what a memory.

24
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,331
Out of the way!

25
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:29,346
Lord, I will never pick another pocket again
as long as I live, I swear it.

26
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,723
But here's the problem.

27
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,476
If you don't let me live,
how can I prove my good faith to you?

28
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,314
If you've heard me,
this ledge will remain steady as a rock,

29
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,733
and that thing coming at me
won't be what I think it is.

30
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:46,405
If it is, there's no hard feelings,
of course, but I'd be very disappointed.

31
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,536
I don't believe it.

32
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,334
I believe it.

33
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,759
I'm coming. I'm coming!

34
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,011
It's Phillipe, Lord.

35
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,514
Phillipe.

36
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,911
You won't regret this, Lord.
I'm a wonderful person.

37
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,292
Boy.

38
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,714
Hello. What are you doing down there?

39
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,592
Get away! Get away, get away, get away!

40
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,886
Come back. Come back!

41
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,744
There's disturbing news, Your Grace.
One of the prisoners has escaped.

42
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,874
No one ever escapes
from the dungeons of Aquila, Marquet.

43
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,002
The people of this city accept
that as a historical fact.

44
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,297
-The responsibility is mine.
-Yes.

45
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:15,387
It would be a miracle if he manages
to get through the sewage system.

46
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,973
I believe in miracles, Marquet.

47
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,268
It's part of my job.

48
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,899
At any rate, Your Grace,
it is only one insignificant, petty thief.

49
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,152
Great storms announce themselves
with a simple breeze, Captain.

50
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,989
And a single random spark
can ignite the fires of rebellion.

51
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,494
If he is out there, Your Grace,
I shall find him.

52
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,412
Yes.

53
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:58,597
Take 10 men towards Chenet!
We ride north to Gavroche!

54
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,308
The name of the man
who finds Phillipe Gaston

55
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,979
will be brought to the personal attention
of the Bishop,

56
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,649
as will the body of the man
who lets him get away!

57
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,359
Open the gates!

58
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,236
I know I promised, Lord. Never again.

59
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,408
But I also know that you know
what a weak-willed person I am.

60
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:35,110
Come on, Mouse. Keep going.
Not much farther.

61
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,615
About 350 miles. That's all.

62
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,955
A nice, hot piece of cabbage,
like my dear, old mother used to cook.

63
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,585
Wolf. Wolf.

64
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,254
Please, no wolf.

65
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,759
A joint of lamb.

66
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,680
Where the hell am I?

67
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,725
Hot lamb. Hot lamb. A little sauce on it.

68
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,938
Maybe some of that green stuff
little Bertram used to put on it.

69
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,345
-Hello.
-Hello.

70
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,305
-Hello.
-Look up there.

71
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,517
He's taking Daddy's shoes.

72
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,103
You've got it, little darlings.

73
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,927
Innkeeper.

74
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,099
-A drink of your most expensive.
-Yeah, yeah. Show me your money.

75
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,145
Copper, my friend.

76
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,732
And the same for anyone
who will join me in a toast.

77
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,567
Let's hear your toast.

78
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,530
We drink to a special man, my friend.

79
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,533
Someone who has been inside
the dungeons of Aquila

80
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,076
and lived to tell the tale.

81
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,078
Then you drink to me, little man.

82
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,414
I've seen those dungeons.

83
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,333
A blacksmith, perhaps?

84
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,795
A carpenter? A stonecutter, even?
But a prisoner from inside Aquila?

85
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,840
I didn't say I was a prisoner.

86
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:11,517
If you'd stuck to the woods,
you may have stood a chance, Gaston.

87
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,726
You're right.

88
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,229
Get him.

89
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,289
Move! Move!

90
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,127
Get out of the way.

91
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,631
You, I said, out!

92
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,147
I'm so terribly sorry.

93
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,527
Kill him.

94
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,994
May God have mercy on my soul!

95
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,968
You, out.

96
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,985
One of my men told me you returned.

97
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:32,282
I wanted to cut his throat for lying,
'cause I knew you weren't that stupid.

98
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,332
-Captain Navarre.
-Francesco.

99
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,711
Captain?

100
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,126
Navarre!

101
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,011
I won't hurt you. I'm a wonderful person.

102
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,265
After him!

103
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,854
Sweet ponies. Gentle... Come here.
You filthy strumpets!

104
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,959
No. No, no, no, no.

105
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,128
No, no, no, no.

106
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,886
No!

107
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,006
Must be somebody's home. There's smoke.

108
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,011
Are you sure you don't want to ride on, sir?
There's still plenty of light.

109
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,265
Stop your chattering.
We'll spend the night here.

110
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,031
Give me the ax. The ax.

111
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,992
Good afternoon, sir. My lady.

112
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,120
My comrade-in-arms and I need lodging
for the night.

113
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,456
No. No place for you here.

114
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,791
We'll pay for it, of course.

115
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,629
We are not above compassion
for those in misery.

116
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,095
You may sleep down there, in the barn.

117
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,180
Thank you.

118
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,816
Sir? Sir, are you there?

119
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,404
If there's nothing else I can do,
I think I'll turn in.

120
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,491
-You can take care of my horse.
-All right.

121
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,452
And sleep with one eye open.

122
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,121
And don't disturb me.

123
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm liable to take your head off
before I know it's you.

124
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,043
All right. Come on, old girl.

125
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,796
Come on.

126
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,549
Stubborn little lady. What's her name?

127
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,636
His name is Goliath.

128
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,138
His name? Pretty name.

129
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,140
Go with him, boy.
He didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

130
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,433
Come on.

131
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:55,647
Goliath, before we get to know
each other better,

132
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,068
I feel I should tell you a story
about a teeny, little man named David.

133
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,213
One day.

134
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,604
"Comrade-in-arms."

135
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,274
Slave's more like it.

136
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,278
See to the fire, feed the animals,
gather the wood.

137
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,992
Look at me, Lord.
I was better off in the dungeons of Aquila.

138
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,455
My cellmate was insane and a murderer,

139
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,957
but he respected me.

140
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,712
He's a strange one, Navarre.
Why did he save my life?

141
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,131
He wants something from me.

142
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,216
I can see it in his eyes.

143
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:10,096
Well, whatever it is, I'm not going to do it.

144
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,309
I'm still a young man, you know.
I've got prospects!

145
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,897
I'm off to find my golden future, Captain.
So, goodbye and good...

146
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,832
Hello?

147
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,219
Who do you think is out there?

148
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,597
You'd better draw your sword, Pierre.

149
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,018
Ah! Louis, you brought your crossbow.

150
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:00,897
We'll all go back to the barn now, all right?

151
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,941
All right.
All right.

152
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,241
Show no mercy, Pierre!
We're not interested in prisoners.

153
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,160
Hold your ground, Louis.
I'll run ahead and get some help.

154
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,403
Captain! Sir! Captain!

155
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,532
Sir! Sir! Sir!

156
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,285
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

157
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,704
Sir! Sir!

158
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,416
Wolf! Wolf!

159
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,585
Wolf. Wolf.

160
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,884
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

161
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,444
Shh...

162
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,583
Don't go out there! Don't go out there!

163
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,418
There's a wolf, a big wolf.

164
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,587
The biggest wolf you've ever seen,
and a dead man.

165
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,880
I know.

166
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,848
Miss! Please!

167
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,027
Maybe I'm dreaming.

168
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,865
But my eyes are open,
which means maybe I'm awake

169
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,951
dreaming I'm asleep.

170
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,328
Or, more likely,

171
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,748
maybe I'm asleep, dreaming that I'm awake

172
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,750
wondering if I'm dreaming.

173
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,502
You are dreaming.

174
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,750
I have not seen what I have just seen.
I do not believe what I believe, Lord.

175
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,753
These are magical, unexplainable matters,

176
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,298
and I beg you
not to make me a part of them.

177
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,092
We'll stop now.

178
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,263
Not a great day for traveling.

179
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,392
Come on, old girl.

180
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,811
Come on... I mean, boy. Goliath.

181
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,397
Come on, Goliath.

182
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:14,108
Come on. It's cold out here. Come on!

183
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,783
I could do with some rest myself,
after last night's goings-on.

184
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,246
The wolf would have killed me.
It was horrible.

185
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:31,834
But he tore the farmer's throat out
and left me alone.

186
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:36,964
And there was more.

187
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:43,221
There was a woman,
like fine porcelain with deep blue eyes.

188
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,473
Almost like a bird's.

189
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,602
And her voice,

190
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,897
the dulcet tones of an angel.

191
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,567
She spoke? What did she say?

192
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:01,030
I asked her if I was dreaming.
She said I was.

193
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,324
Hmm.

194
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,702
I'm not insane. You must believe me
when I tell you these things.

195
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:10,289
No, I believe you. I believe in dreams.

196
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,084
I see.

197
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,506
This lady, did she perhaps have a name?

198
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,092
Not that she mentioned. Why?

199
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,805
Well, she might wander into my dreams.

200
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,891
Wouldn't it be nice

201
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,312
if I could call her by name
and pretend we'd met before?

202
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,613
I've waited a long time for such a lady.

203
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,910
Now, get some sleep.

204
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,337
The bird will alert us if anyone comes.

205
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,095
I've got to be out of my mind.

206
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,556
Out of my mind.

207
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,374
Open the gate!

208
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,792
Open the gate!

209
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,934
Have you found the criminal,
Gaston?

210
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,396
He is not in my custody at this time.

211
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,731
Then why do you invade my garden,
unwashed, unshaved?

212
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,983
Do you think to find him here?

213
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,405
Navarre has returned.

214
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,163
Walk with me.

215
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:11,721
The criminal, Gaston, travels with him.
My men are combing the woods.

216
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,264
And the hawk?

217
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,891
-Your Grace?
-There must be a hawk.

218
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,936
A spirited hawk.

219
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,356
This hawk is not to be harmed.
Is that understood?

220
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,028
You see, the day she dies, a new captain
of the guard will preside at your execution.

221
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:30,281
We live in difficult times, Marquet.

222
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,533
This famine has prevented the people

223
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,118
from paying their proper tribute
to the Church.

224
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:38,789
I raise their taxes only to be told that
there is nothing left for me to tax. Imagine.

225
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:42,877
But last night,
the Lord Almighty visited me in my sleep.

226
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,338
He told me

227
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:49,383
that Satan's messenger
is traveling amongst us. And that his name

228
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,304
is Etienne of Navarre.

229
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,307
Go.

230
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,311
To break faith with me
is to break faith with Him.

231
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,697
-Get me Cezar.
-Yes, Your Grace.

232
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,976
This sword has been in my family
for five generations.

233
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:44,480
It has never known defeat, until now.

234
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,943
This jewel represents my family name.

235
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,197
This one is our alliance
with the Holy Church in Rome.

236
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,534
This one was my father's,

237
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,912
from the Crusades.

238
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,997
And this...

239
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:05,543
-Sir, you don't think I took that one?
-No.

240
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,420
This is mine to fill.

241
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,550
Each generation is called upon
to follow its own quest.

242
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,676
And what is your quest?

243
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,305
I must kill a man.

244
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,809
Tell me,
does this walking corpse have a name?

245
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,733
His Grace, the Bishop of Aquila.

246
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,652
The Bishop. I see.

247
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:38,075
Well... Well, then you have much to do.

248
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,912
And I've already been enough of a burden
to you.

249
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,291
I do hope our paths cross again one day.

250
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,293
I need you to guide me into the city.

251
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,880
Not for the life of my mother,
even if I knew who she was.

252
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,382
You're the only one
who has ever escaped from there.

253
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:57,303
It was chance, pure chance.
A miracle. Once in a lifetime.

254
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,223
I fell down a hole, and followed my nose.

255
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:08,022
I have waited almost two years
for a sign from God.

256
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,567
So when I heard
the warning bells of Aquila,

257
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,528
I knew the moment
of my destiny had come.

258
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,906
You will be my guiding angel.

259
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,032
Me?

260
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,661
Sir, the truth is I talk to God all the time.

261
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,747
And, no offense,
but he never mentioned you.

262
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:26,540
No?

263
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,295
There are strange forces at work
in your life.

264
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,131
Magical ones that surround you.

265
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:37,218
I don't understand them,
but they frighten me.

266
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,429
You have given me my life.

267
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,890
The truth is, I can never repay you.

268
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,476
I have no honor. I never will have.

269
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,606
I don't think that you would kill me
for being what I am.

270
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:56,695
But better that, than to return to Aquila.

271
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,461
I'll gather some wood for the fire.

272
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,981
-Got you.
- Miss?

273
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,526
My lady? Up here.

274
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,863
Damn.

275
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:40,030
You remember me?

276
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,741
What are you doing up there?

277
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,787
What am I doing? Yes, you might ask that.

278
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:48,956
The Bishop's guards.

279
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,709
A dozen of them. We had a terrible fight.

280
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,712
-Why didn't they kill you?
-Why didn't they?

281
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:58,048
That's a good question.
I asked them that myself.

282
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,676
-And?
-"And?"

283
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,137
And what did they say?

284
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:07,558
They said that they preferred
to leave that honor to the Bishop.

285
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,310
Oh.

286
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,395
They're coming back.

287
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,481
-They are, are they?
-Please, my lady.

288
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,360
A giant owl examined me quite closely,
not one minute ago.

289
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,198
Please?

290
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:28,370
Please.

291
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,671
You're very kind.

292
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,725
Listen.

293
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:55,522
Thank you very much, my lady.
Tell the captain he ties a wicked knot.

294
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,527
He's going to kill me.

295
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,706
Good morning.

296
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,168
Let's go find Phillipe.

297
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,306
Well, well.

298
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,102
A long way from the sewers, little rat.

299
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,397
This time the drinks are on me.

300
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,275
-Where's Navarre?
-Navarre? Navarre?

301
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,737
Yes, yes. Big man, black horse?

302
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,199
Uh... I saw him riding south, toward Aquila.

303
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,660
Then, we ride north, sir.

304
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,497
It's not polite to assume somebody is a liar
when you've only just met them.

305
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,333
And yet, you knew we would.

306
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,796
We ride south, toward Aquila.

307
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,508
-I told the truth, Lord.
-Move.

308
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,762
How can I learn any moral lessons
if you keep confusing me like this?

309
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,631
Hawk!

310
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,426
No.

311
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,316
Easy. You'll be all right.

312
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,902
No.

313
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,911
Get me a piece of cloth from my saddlebag.

314
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,416
Easy. Don't be afraid. It's all right.

315
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,960
It's all right.

316
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,591
Thanks.

317
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,595
You'll be all right. You'll be fine.

318
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,222
You'll live.

319
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,352
Take her. Find help.

320
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,564
-Me, sir?
-You're the only one I have.

321
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,275
-But, sir, the poor thing is done for.
-Don't you say that!

322
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,740
Follow that road,
you'll find a ruined castle.

323
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,700
There's a monk named Imperius.

324
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,036
Give him the hawk.
He will know what to do.

325
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,663
-Sir, I don't think you understand...
-Get on my horse.

326
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,207
You're the only who can ride him.

327
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,835
You will do as I tell you.
Get on my horse, now!

328
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,804
Careful.

329
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,226
And know this,

330
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,188
if you fail,
I will follow you the length of my days.

331
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,648
And I will find you.

332
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,110
Go. Run.

333
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:53,946
Go!

334
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:28,897
There it is, see? The castle.
We'll be there soon.

335
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,903
Well. Well, that's gratitude for you.

336
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,782
All right, then.
Let this Imperius fellow watch you die.

337
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,367
I've got my own life to live after.

338
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,130
Please.

339
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:01,888
Hello!

340
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:05,892
Hello, up there!

341
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,395
For pity's sake, hello!

342
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,106
Hello, hello!

343
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,234
What do you want down there?

344
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,822
I was told to bring you this bird.
It's been wounded.

345
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,407
Good shot!

346
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,367
Bring it in, we'll dine together.

347
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:23,910
We can't eat this bird!

348
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,873
Why not? God, is it Lent again already?

349
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:33,462
This is no ordinary hawk, Father.
It belongs to a man named Navarre.

350
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:38,133
Mother of God.
Bring her in! Bring her in! Quickly!

351
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,140
Stay.

352
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,309
Good bird.

353
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,104
Up here, boy. Hurry!

354
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,773
Hurry!

355
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,569
Oh...

356
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,739
Here. Up here.

357
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,616
This way.

358
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:08,372
Now, careful.
Walk on the left side. On the left.

359
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,800
There.

360
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:37,025
Gently.

361
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,870
Now, leave us.

362
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,248
-Can I help?
-Go out, boy.

363
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,801
Don't be frightened.

364
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,928
Navarre was right.

365
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,556
I know what to do.

366
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,687
We must wait a little.

367
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,829
Now then, where is that...

368
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:35,375
There we are.
Now then, what am I going to need?

369
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,130
Celeriac, rosemary, thyme.
Did I light the fire?

370
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:57,439
It's late. Thyme, I need thyme.

371
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,400
Now, I need a root. There! That's it.

372
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,500
Navarre. Is he...

373
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,336
He's fine.

374
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,173
He's just fine, my lady.

375
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,262
There was a terrible battle.
Navarre fought like a lion.

376
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,267
The hawk...

377
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,230
The hawk was struck.

378
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,192
You know that, don't you?

379
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:43,860
Yes.

380
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,201
Are you flesh?

381
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,995
Or are you spirit?

382
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,500
I am sorrow.

383
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:07,717
How...

384
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,656
Get out.

385
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,367
Out, out.

386
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,245
This time, stay out!

387
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,546
Ready?

388
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,066
Forgive me, Your Grace. Cezar has arrived.

389
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,061
It's him, isn't it?

390
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,731
-The wolf. Somehow, it's him.
-Drink. Forget.

391
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,360
An hour ago you were drunk,
and you remembered.

392
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,030
-What do they call you, boy?
-Phillipe Gaston.

393
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,407
Uh-huh.

394
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,412
Her name is Isabeau d'Anjou.

395
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:44,791
Her father was the Comte d'Anjou,
an intemperate fellow.

396
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,128
He died slaughtering Saracens in Antioch.

397
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:54,968
She came to live with a cousin,
I think it was, in Aquila.

398
00:50:56,178 --> 00:51:00,640
I shall never forget the first time
I saw her. It was like looking at...

399
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,684
The face of love.

400
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:04,978
You, too.

401
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,065
Well, I suppose we were all in love with her
in different ways.

402
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:12,569
Even His Grace, the Bishop,
could think of nothing else.

403
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,903
The Bishop loved her?

404
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:17,824
As near as that evil man could come to it.

405
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,202
His passion was a sort of madness.

406
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,912
He was a man possessed.

407
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,124
But Isabeau sensed his wickedness,
and she shrank from him.

408
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,794
She sent back all his letters unopened,
his poems unread.

409
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,089
Her heart was already lost, you see,

410
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,800
to the captain of the guard.

411
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,012
Etienne Navarre!

412
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,890
The Bishop knew nothing of their love.

413
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:45,685
But every day saw it grow stronger
and deeper and richer.

414
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,730
Until...

415
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,037
Until?

416
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,292
They were betrayed.

417
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,840
They shared the same confessor,
a weak and foolish priest.

418
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:21,054
And one day, in a drunken confession
to his superior, he committed a mortal sin.

419
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:25,350
He revealed the lovers' secret vows
to the Bishop.

420
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,188
The old fool didn't realize
what he had done at first,

421
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,982
nor the terrible revenge
the Bishop would take.

422
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:37,320
His Grace seemed to go mad.
He lost both his sanctity and his reason.

423
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:41,491
He swore that if he could not have her,
no man would.

424
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:47,622
So, Navarre and Isabeau fled from Aquila.

425
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,709
But the Bishop followed,
never more than an hour behind,

426
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:54,212
and more persistent than a hound.

427
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:58,258
An evil man, a powerful man,
hated and feared.

428
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,760
Rejected even by Rome herself.

429
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:07,433
He called upon the powers of darkness
for the means to damn the lovers.

430
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:13,606
In his fury and frustration,
he struck a dreadful bargain

431
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,528
with the evil one.

432
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:24,117
The dark powers of hell

433
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,204
spat up a terrible curse,
and you have seen it working.

434
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:33,376
By day, Isabeau is the beautiful bird
you brought to me.

435
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,755
And by night, as you have already guessed,

436
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,551
the voice of the wolf that we hear

437
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,846
is the cry of Navarre.

438
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:50,018
Poor, dumb creatures with no memory
of the half-life of their human existence.

439
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,645
Never touching in the flesh.

440
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,900
Only the anguish of a split second
at sunrise and sunset

441
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:59,110
when they can almost touch,

442
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:01,946
but not.

443
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,242
Always together. Eternally apart.

444
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:12,790
As long as the sun rises and sets,
as long as there is day and night.

445
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,836
And for as long as they both shall live.

446
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:26,220
You have stumbled onto a tragic story,
Phillipe Gaston.

447
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,266
And now, whether you like it or not,

448
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,478
you are lost in it, with the rest of us.

449
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,677
Useless.

450
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,637
All of them.

451
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,389
My traps are full.

452
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,433
I can't kill every wolf that lives.

453
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:15,687
Since the plague,
there are more wolves than men.

454
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,481
And there's a woman.

455
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:20,274
Your Grace?

456
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,570
A beautiful woman

457
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,368
with alabaster skin, and the eyes of a dove.

458
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,834
She travels by night, only by night.
Her sun is the moon.

459
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,086
And her name is

460
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,341
Isabeau.

461
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:50,179
Find her, and you find the wolf.

462
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,641
The wolf I want.

463
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,226
The wolf who

464
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,354
loves her.

465
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,276
A black wolf.

466
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,741
Isabeau.

467
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,718
Don't. Don't.

468
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,096
You might start bleeding again.

469
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,979
Tell me your name.

470
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,149
Most people call me Phillipe the Mouse.

471
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,028
You travel with him, don't you?

472
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,322
Yes.

473
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,174
"You must save this hawk," he said.

474
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:13,429
"For she is my life,
my last and best reason for living."

475
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,061
And then he said,

476
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:28,319
"One day we will know such happiness
as two people dream of, but never do."

477
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:37,286
He said that?

478
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,124
I swear it on my life.

479
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,528
-Does she know?
-What?

480
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:14,282
That you were the priest
that betrayed them?

481
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:17,326
God has declared an end to it, at last.

482
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,788
He has given me the knowledge
to undo what I have done.

483
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:24,333
After two years,
he has brought us back together again.

484
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,337
Make yourself clear, if you can.

485
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,884
I have found a way to break the curse

486
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,637
and a time for Navarre
to confront the Bishop

487
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,598
and to begin his own true life again.

488
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:42,602
He intends to confront the Bishop,
to kill him with the sword of his ancestors.

489
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,936
No, he mustn't do that. He can't.

490
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,440
If he kills the Bishop,
the curse can never be broken.

491
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,653
Go look after Isabeau, boy. Go, quickly.

492
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:03,414
Open up the door, in the name
of His Holiness, the Bishop of Aquila!

493
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:08,753
Be off with you!
This is a house of God, not a brothel!

494
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,880
I said open up, in the name of the Bishop!

495
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:15,760
I met the Bishop, you blasphemous lout!
And you look nothing like him.

496
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,762
-Break it in!
-Yes, sir.

497
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,766
Left side, left side, left side.

498
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,606
Come on.

499
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:35,404
My lady. My lady.
Come with me.

500
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,156
-What is it?
-Don't talk, come with me.

501
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,246
Sorry!

502
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,498
I am a monk, not an architect!

503
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,508
Move, imbecile!

504
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,806
In here, my lady.

505
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,816
This way, my chum.
Straight through the big main doors.

506
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,984
And don't forget...

507
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:22,743
Walk on the left side.

508
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,297
Careful. Hurry.

509
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,639
Go back! Go back! Back inside! Run!

510
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,277
I got you!

511
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,071
He's got me!
Get off, get off, get off!

512
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,073
Get off of me.

513
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:03,492
My boots!

514
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:21,260
-Phillipe, it's me they're after.
-Don't flatter yourself.

515
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,547
Hold me!

516
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,549
I'm slipping!

517
01:02:02,511 --> 01:02:03,552
No!

518
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,439
You!

519
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,524
-Where's the woman?
-She flew away.

520
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,734
-Where is she?
-God's truth, she flew away!

521
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:02,528
You...

522
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,050
It always pays to tell the truth, Lord.

523
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,720
Thank you. I see that now.

524
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,902
I thought you might have been dead,
old man.

525
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,905
There were times
I wanted to kill you myself.

526
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:50,034
But I'm very grateful for this.

527
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,915
No, it is I who should be grateful

528
01:03:56,249 --> 01:04:01,629
to have the chance to redeem myself,
and to save you and Isabeau,

529
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:06,550
because God has told me
how the curse may be broken.

530
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,932
You have betrayed us once. I warn you.

531
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:19,146
Three days hence, the Bishop will hear
the confession of the clergy

532
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,732
in the cathedral in Aquila.

533
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:26,195
All you have to do is confront him,
both of you, as man and woman,

534
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:27,988
in the flesh.

535
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,117
And the curse will be confounded, broken.

536
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,954
And both of you will be free!

537
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:40,501
-Impossible.
-As long as there is night and day, no.

538
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:45,965
But three days hence in Aquila,
there will be a day without a night

539
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,217
and a night without a day.

540
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,597
Go back inside, old man.
Go back to your drink.

541
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,808
You think I'm drunk?

542
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,561
I swear to you!

543
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,938
God has shown me!

544
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,649
He has forgiven me.

545
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,652
He hasn't forgiven you.

546
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:09,989
He's made you mad.

547
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:17,830
Sir. Sir.

548
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:29,466
It's all right, Father. Sir?

549
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,595
Sir.

550
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:36,599
How's your shoulder?

551
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:43,230
-I'm in your debt.
-Me, sir? No, no, not at all.

552
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:47,276
She wanted me to deliver a message,

553
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,112
to say she still has hope, faith in you.

554
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,411
-You are free to go.
-I know that, sir.

555
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,538
-Do as you like.
-Yes, sir.

556
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,417
Then you and Ladyhawke
will be going on to Aquila?

557
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,710
Ladyhawke?

558
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:09,131
Yes.

559
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:15,929
Well, it just so happens, I'm heading
in that general direction myself.

560
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,307
Really?

561
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:26,106
Then you better grab your things.
I'm leaving now.

562
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:27,358
Right.

563
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,864
Ladyhawke.

564
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:40,037
Imperius, I'm leaving with the captain.
Follow us.

565
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,175
But if the old man's right
about breaking the curse,

566
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:57,471
if you and Isabeau could face
the Bishop together, as man and woman...

567
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:02,059
You will not mention that again.
Not to me, not to her.

568
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,811
Understood?

569
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,733
Abraham,
will you get a move on?

570
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,115
Looks like a big one, Captain.
We're going to get soaked.

571
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,410
Find shelter.

572
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,704
Come here.

573
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,707
-The sun is going down.
-How can you tell?

574
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,459
After so many sunsets?

575
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,088
Take care of Ladyhawke.

576
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,557
Tell her I love her.

577
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,782
You hungry?

578
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,997
Do you understand me, Ladyhawke?

579
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:11,420
You know,
it's my favorite thing for dinner, hawk.

580
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,215
I've eaten thousands of them.
Used to kill one every night.

581
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,139
Serves me right
for getting involved in this nightmare.

582
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,974
Nightmare, daymare.

583
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:28,854
And then, "A night without day,
a day without night."

584
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,857
What's that supposed to mean?

585
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,319
Makes about as much sense
as the rest of it.

586
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:36,820
Uh-oh.

587
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:37,946
Sunset.

588
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,034
I'll wait outside.

589
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,585
Hold on for a minute.

590
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,868
I can't vouch for the fit.

591
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:29,915
Take your time, my lady.

592
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,376
Miss.

593
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,797
My lady?

594
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,216
I'm coming in.

595
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:31,143
Miss?

596
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,316
It's me, remember?

597
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,238
You?

598
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:44,823
Yeah.

599
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,074
Thank you.

600
01:10:50,622 --> 01:10:52,998
-How is he?
-He's alive, like you.

601
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,209
He's full of hope, like you.

602
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,837
He left you in my charge.

603
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:03,675
He said, "Tell her we two speak as one,

604
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,887
"and she will follow your instructions
as my own."

605
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,013
Really?

606
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,474
-I...
-No, don't swear.

607
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,731
Good evening, Goliath.

608
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,655
He's taking us back to Aquila, isn't he?

609
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,329
Well, what do you instruct?

610
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,543
I instruct you to sit by a warm fire,

611
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,630
to drink a cup of sweet wine,

612
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,759
and to listen to bright music,
cheerfully played.

613
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,220
Perhaps, dance.

614
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:56,061
Shall we, my lady? Dance?

615
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:00,107
-Now?
-Practice.

616
01:12:32,724 --> 01:12:35,976
Oh, my.
It has been a long time, Phillipe.

617
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,813
I'll take my cup of sweet wine now.

618
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,231
All right.

619
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:54,953
So, you intend to be my protector, as well?
I'm flattered.

620
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:58,749
Actually, the truth is,
he'll kill me if I lose it.

621
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,302
-You stole my dress?
-I wouldn't...

622
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,477
Isabeau. Isabeau.

623
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:22,105
Isabeau.

624
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,691
-Get inside.
-No!

625
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:26,109
Get inside!

626
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,529
If you lay one hand on her,

627
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,656
you'll find it on the ground,
next to your head!

628
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:35,619
-Now, ride on!
-Easy, little man, you're frightening me.

629
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,704
Are you deaf? Ride on!

630
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:46,421
Turn around, and you're dead!

631
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,930
What a terrible night.

632
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:07,359
Isabeau!

633
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:21,623
He'll kill me.

634
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,922
Show yourself, coward!

635
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,649
My beauty.

636
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:20,951
Navarre!

637
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,829
Black wolf.

638
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,030
Do get on, Abraham.

639
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,118
Go on, faster. It's going to snow soon.

640
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:40,447
Good morning.

641
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,367
-Good morning.
-You look a little pale.

642
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,578
-I got you something to eat.

643
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,413
What a night.

644
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,250
What happened?

645
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:56,129
Nothing I couldn't handle, Captain.

646
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:17,025
It's a good little hawk. Nice bird.

647
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,695
Go on now. Go to your master.

648
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:23,323
-Go on, Ladyhawke.
-Last night...

649
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,867
-Captain?
-Tell me about it.

650
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,079
What's to tell? Go on now.
Go on. Go, go, go!

651
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,206
We ran into a bit of trouble
on our way to an inn.

652
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:33,249
You took Isabeau to an inn?

653
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,004
First, we had to go to a stable.
Fly to your master, fly to the one you love.

654
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:40,632
-What did you do in a stable?
-We changed clothes.

655
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,967
-What?
-Not together, of course.

656
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,719
-You left her alone?
-No, never.

657
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,888
-So, you did change?
-No, no, no. No.

658
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:48,390
-Take her.
-Come here.

659
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,642
Take her, take her, take her.

660
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:02,112
She's the most wonderful woman
that ever lived.

661
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,782
And I can't say I haven't had my fantasies.

662
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,493
But the truth is,
all she did was talk about you.

663
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,045
Every moment you spend with her,

664
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,506
I envy you.

665
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,351
But you can tell me.

666
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,312
Tell me everything that she said.

667
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:42,026
And I warn you,
I will know if the words are hers.

668
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,043
She was sad at first.

669
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,882
She talked about the day you met,
and she cursed it.

670
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:13,475
But then I saw her remember
how happy you were together,

671
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:16,394
before the Bishop's curse,

672
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,230
and her eyes glowed.

673
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:21,900
No, she glowed.

674
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,447
She loves you more than life, Captain.
She's had to.

675
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:33,411
Do you know that hawks and wolves
mate for life?

676
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:37,123
Yeah.

677
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:41,503
The Bishop didn't even leave us that.

678
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:43,922
Not even that.

679
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:24,796
On your way to kill His Grace?

680
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,423
Why won't you listen to me?

681
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:29,759
In two days' time,

682
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:33,888
you can face the Bishop in the cathedral
with Isabeau by your side

683
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:35,723
and break the curse.

684
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,893
I will be in Aquila tomorrow.

685
01:21:38,978 --> 01:21:43,147
And one way or another,
there will finally be an end to it.

686
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,650
One day, more or less.

687
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:48,361
-What could it matter?
- You, too?

688
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,322
I warned you.

689
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,618
-Stay here, then, with the old man.
-No. I'm going with you.

690
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:58,121
How will you get inside the cathedral
without me?

691
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:00,623
I will get in, without your help.

692
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,347
Thank you for trying, Phillipe,
and for standing up for the truth.

693
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,310
I should've known better.

694
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:23,605
Every happy moment in my life
has come from lying.

695
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:12,195
There you are, little Mouse.

696
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:15,114
Where is my knife?

697
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,659
-Isabeau?
-I just had it here.

698
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,327
Now, what have I done with it?

699
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,205
Isabeau, this may be
our last evening together.

700
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,962
-Why?
-I didn't want to tell you until I believed.

701
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,507
I mean, really believed.

702
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,385
Really believed what, Phillipe?

703
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,804
I think we can break the curse.

704
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,810
We have a plan.

705
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:50,066
-You and Navarre?
-No.

706
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:03,538
Must you keep thumping me
in the liver?

707
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:12,922
Imperius, this hole's not big enough
for the two of us.

708
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:17,218
Well, let's hope it's
big enough for the wolf.

709
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,440
Ow!

710
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,196
What are you doing?

711
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:43,077
When you kneel before the altar,
how do you get up again?

712
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:45,246
You sacrilegious young imp!

713
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,290
Go on, push. Blast you!

714
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,334
And more. Again!

715
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,503
And again! Up!

716
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:54,672
Up!

717
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,301
He's coming! He's coming!

718
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:03,639
-Phillipe!
-My lady, my lady,

719
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,308
we're just covering the trap.

720
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,143
All right. Hurry.

721
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:30,208
He's coming across the ice.

722
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:42,720
- Wait, my lady.
-Phillipe! Help me!

723
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:49,310
The ice, it will break!
Lie down! Lie down!

724
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:53,064
He can't get out!

725
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,450
Wait!

726
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,078
Wait, my lady!

727
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,998
God, Phillipe! I can't make it!

728
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,416
-Hurry!
- I'm coming.

729
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:19,090
Hurry, boy! We'll lose him!

730
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,509
Wait!

731
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,595
He's too heavy! He's too...

732
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,599
Phillipe... No! He's slipping! He's...

733
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:34,438
Hold him!

734
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:36,816
Stop! Be careful!

735
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,151
No!

736
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:40,987
Isabeau!

737
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:42,113
No!

738
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:43,489
Isabeau, hold him up!

739
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:49,161
-No! Phillipe!
-Phillipe! No!

740
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,913
Phillipe!

741
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,084
No! No!

742
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,382
Push. Push.

743
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,055
It's all right.

744
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,148
Hold on.

745
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,358
Hold on, boy!

746
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,677
We must live, Father.

747
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:49,972
As human beings.

748
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:55,061
Our lives are in your hands now.

749
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,924
Tell me one thing,
where is my father's sword?

750
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:55,968
It's gone.

751
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:58,804
It fell through the ice last night,
crossing the river.

752
01:31:58,889 --> 01:32:00,181
Damn you.

753
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,516
That sword was the last bit of honor
I possessed.

754
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:05,186
There is no mission of honor now.

755
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:07,354
The jewel that you wished to place
in your sword hilt

756
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:10,441
has become a symbol
of your meaningless death.

757
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:15,321
But there is a chance for life now.
A new life with her.

758
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:18,782
I needed that sword to kill the Bishop!

759
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:20,367
Navarre, listen to him!

760
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:21,827
-Damn you!
-Go ahead then.

761
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:23,329
Kill yourself! Kill her, too!

762
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,497
You never cared for her
as much as yourself anyway.

763
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:38,135
What is that?

764
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,014
That happened last night,
when he saved your life.

765
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:50,606
Forgive me.

766
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:05,829
I'll show you idiots how to cage a wolf.

767
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:13,837
Quickly!

768
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,258
Get out of the way there!

769
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:28,686
Remember, the cul-de-sac
is by the great north wall.

770
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,939
Right, right. Cul-de-sac, great north wall.

771
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,857
Come on. Come on.

772
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,703
We have come full circle, Lord.

773
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:51,250
I would like to think that there is
some higher meaning in all of this.

774
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:53,877
Certainly would reflect well on you.

775
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:06,181
Halt!

776
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:09,184
What have we here, little Father?

777
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,520
A surprise present,

778
01:34:11,938 --> 01:34:17,276
my son, for His Grace, the Bishop,
from the people of my parish.

779
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,781
A fine pelt for his wall.

780
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:27,536
What have we here?

781
01:34:34,836 --> 01:34:38,297
I've never had the pleasure
of killing a wolf before.

782
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:42,384
How strange.
That's exactly what the Bishop said.

783
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:47,014
I'm sure he will understand
your depriving him of that pleasure.

784
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,099
He's a very forgiving sort of a man.

785
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:56,857
Very well. Pass on.

786
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:02,154
Wisdom is beyond price, my son.
Be grateful that you have it.

787
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:50,911
-Your Grace?
-When I am ready.

788
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:44,506
It should be soon now.
Once the clouds break.

789
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:47,217
It's day, old man.

790
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:50,846
Like it was yesterday,
like it will be tomorrow.

791
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:39,228
Oh, no.

792
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:50,822
Damn.

793
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,935
-What's the matter?
-Rats.

794
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,603
Rats? Here?

795
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,316
Scandalous.

796
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:08,525
There's no time left.

797
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:12,070
The Mass will be over soon.
I cannot wait for you now.

798
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:16,700
If Phillipe has done his job,
I can kill the Bishop now or never.

799
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:20,078
No, Etienne,
this chance will never come again!

800
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,331
You're right.

801
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:26,209
If this service ends peacefully,

802
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:29,713
the cathedral bells begin to toll,

803
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,341
and you will know I have failed.

804
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,803
But Isabeau...

805
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,477
I

806
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:50,067
beg you, take her life.

807
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:54,571
Quick and painless.

808
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:57,115
I can't do that.

809
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:59,618
Yes, you can. I beg you.

810
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:02,162
The cruelty would be to damn her
to a half-life.

811
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:04,581
And that is not what she wants.

812
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,168
I couldn't do it.

813
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:13,632
Have you ever considered that
this is what God intended all along?

814
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:57,134
As the one who was your captain

815
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,637
and through God's grace will be once again,

816
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,305
I ask you to let me pass.

817
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,309
Captain Navarre,

818
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:07,436
I have my orders.

819
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,453
Damn it, open!

820
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:33,837
Come on.

821
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,445
Navarre!

822
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:50,432
Thank you, Lord.

823
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:24,693
Night without a day.

824
01:45:26,737 --> 01:45:28,738
Day without a night.

825
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:43,628
Dear Lord, go with him. Be with him.

826
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,679
Imperius! Wait!

827
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,180
No!

828
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:14,659
You're dead.

829
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,497
Stop!

830
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,177
Imperius,

831
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:16,930
make it quick.

832
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:20,225
God, forgive me.

833
01:49:54,088 --> 01:49:55,922
But kill me, Navarre,

834
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:59,717
and the curse will go on forever.

835
01:50:00,469 --> 01:50:01,803
We must think of Isabeau.

836
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:07,684
Isabeau

837
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:09,394
is dead.

838
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:14,941
Damn you.

839
01:50:17,194 --> 01:50:19,862
-Damn you to hell.
- Navarre!

840
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:55,523
Look at her.

841
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:58,234
Look at her!

842
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:09,746
Look at me.

843
01:51:32,978 --> 01:51:34,103
Now,

844
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:36,439
look at us.

845
01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:42,779
Look at us!

846
01:51:48,077 --> 01:51:50,703
It's over. It's broken.

847
01:53:47,404 --> 01:53:48,821
And no man shall...

848
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:51,782
Navarre!

849
01:54:05,672 --> 01:54:08,007
Isabeau.

850
01:55:00,852 --> 01:55:02,645
Oh, my God!

851
01:55:21,373 --> 01:55:22,790
You cut your hair.

852
01:55:25,043 --> 01:55:26,335
I love you.

853
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:28,504
Isabeau.

854
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:29,714
Navarre.

855
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:44,979
You two!

856
01:55:47,899 --> 01:55:49,275
Come here.

857
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:03,831
May God's blessings

858
01:56:04,541 --> 01:56:07,627
be with you both, from this day forward.

859
01:56:08,378 --> 01:56:11,589
I bless the day
he brought you back to us, Father.

860
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:14,800
And you. And you.

861
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:23,434
The truest friend we could ever have.

862
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:29,565
Thank you.

863
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,829
I fully expect to meet you
at the Pearly Gates, little thief.

864
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:46,082
Don't you dare disappoint me.

865
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:50,503
I'll meet you there, Father.
Even if I have to pick the lock.

866
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:56,759
Isabeau!

867
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:10,523
I love you!
